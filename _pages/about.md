I'm Zhizhuo Yang (杨智卓 in Chinese), also known as George, currently working as an AI Research Scientist at [Writer](https://writer.com). My research focuses on advancing large language model post-training techniques, developing intelligent AI agents, and exploring cutting-edge topics in generative artificial intelligence.

I earned my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the Rochester Institute of Technology, where I specialized in active inference and continual reinforcement learning under the guidance of [Dr. Alexander G. Ororbia II](https://www.cs.rit.edu/~ago/) and [Dr. Reynold Bailey](https://www.rit.edu/directory/rjbvcs-reynold-bailey). My doctoral research encompassed deep learning-based eye tracking systems and generative modeling of coordinated eye and head movements. I also maintain active research interests in computer vision and computer graphics, areas that complement my core expertise in AI and machine learning.

I absolutely love playing :basketball: and :badminton:, immersing myself in music, exploring new places through travel, and conquering trails while hiking in my free time. I mastered the :saxophone: at a young age and am currently excitedly learning to play the :guitar:!
