Hi there, my name is Zhizhuo Yang (杨智卓 in Chinese), aka George. I'm a PhD student and a multidisciplinary researcher  majoring in computer science at RIT. My primary research areas are active inference and continual reinforcement learning. My advisor is [Dr. Alexander G. Ororbia II](https://www.cs.rit.edu/~ago/) at Rochester Insitiute of Technology. Previously, I worked on deep learning based eye tracking systems and generative modeling of coordinated eye and head movements. I'm also interested in computer vision and computer graphics.

I love playing :basketball: and :badminton:, listening to music, traveling and hiking in my free time. I learned to play :saxophone: and :guitar: at a young age.
